# Illumio-CodingChallenge

## Implementation

Run time efficent algorithm has been implemented for this challenge by using Hash table to store all unique network rules. Running time is O(1) but the space complexoty is not efficient for cases that take in account ranges of Ports and IP's.

## Testing

I didn't get much time to test my code and hence just implemented unit test for the base workiong case by uploading few rules covering all the permutations for rules.

## Suggested changes

Given more time, I would like to implement/modify Hashmap to a more suitable data structure that can deal with ranges perhaps some other sort of map like RangeMap or NavigableMap or would like to think in the direction of implementing a tree. The details to work out the hash valu or how to exactly go aabout with tree search need to be further pondered upon.
However, as the algorithm's space complexity needs to be improved without much impacting the time complexity and I would like to spend more time in that direction.

Other thing I wanted to work on was the Test cases. The code needs to be checked for dealing with bulk values and I would like to add a test case for the same by creating a file with dummy file as input to consider the maximum input run-time.

### I would like to be considered primarily for the Platform team followed by Policy Team.
